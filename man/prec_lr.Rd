\description{
These functions calculate the precision or sample size for likelihood ratios (LRs).
\code{prec_lr} is a generalized method for that can be used for positive and
negative LRs as well as conditional LRs.

\code{prec_pos_lr} is a wrapper to \code{prec_lr} to ease
calculations for positive likelihood ratios by allowing sensitivity and
specificity to be given explicitly.

\code{prec_neg_lr} is a wrapper to \code{prec_lr} to ease
calculations for negative likelihood ratios by allowing sensitivity and
specificity to be given explicitly.
}
\details{
These functions implement formula 10 from Simel et al 1991.
\code{prec_lr} is a generalized function allowing for many scenarios, while
\code{prec_pos_lr} and \code{prec_neg_lr} are specific to positive and
negative likelihood ratios in the 2*2 setting (e.g. disease status and test
positive/negative).

For the positive likelihood ratio (LR+), in a 2x2 style experiment, \code{p1}
should be sensitivity, \code{p2} should be 1-specificity. Alternatively, use
\code{prec_pos_lr}.

For the negative likelihood ratio (LR-), in a 2x2 style experiment, \code{p1}
should be 1-sensitivity, \code{p2} should be specificity. Alternatively, use
\code{prec_neg_lr}.

For conditional likelihood ratios with 3x2 tables, such as positive or
negative tests against inconclusive ones (yields), \code{p1} would be the
proportion of positive or negative tests in the diseased group and \code{p2}
would be the proportion of positive or negative tests in the non-diseased group.

\examples{
# equal numbers of diseased/non-diseased, 80\% sens, 73\% spec, 74 participants total
prec_lr(.5, .8, .27, 74)

# Simel et al 1991, problem 1 - LR+ CI width from N
# Sensitivity of a new test is at least 80\%, specificity is 73\% and the LR+
# is 2.96 (= 0.8/(1-0.73)). We have as many diseased as not diseased
# (n1 = n2, n = 2*n1 = 146.8, prevalence = .5)
prec_lr(prev = .5, p1 = .8, p2 = 1-.73, n = 146.8)
prec_pos_lr(prev = .5, sens = .8, spec = .73, n = 146.8)

# problem 1 of Simel et al actually derives n1 rather than the width of the
# confidence interval (ie N from CI width). If we know that the lower limit
# of the CI should be 2.0, the confidence interval width is approximately
# exp(2*(log(2.96) - log(2))) = 2.19 (approximate because the CI Of the LR
# is only symetrical on the log(LR) scale), which we can put in conf.width
prec_lr(prev = .5, p1 = .8, p2 = 1-.73, conf.width = 2.2)
prec_pos_lr(prev = .5, sens = .8, spec = .73, conf.width = 2.2)

# Simel et al 1991, problem 2 - LR- CI width from N
# p1 = 1 - sens = .1, p2 = spec = .5
# n1 = n2, n = 160, prev = .5
